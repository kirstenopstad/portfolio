# Portfolio Landing Page

#### By Kirsten Opstad

#### A simple dev portfolio landing page!

## Technologies Used

* HTML 
* CSS 

## Description

This in an independent student project written for an Epicodus weekly code review. The intention is to build a solid foundation of a dev portfolio website to begin documenting and showcasing my work. 

**Check it out! [Live](https://kirstenopstad.github.io/portfolio/) on GitHub Pages!**


### Initial Project Requirements (MVP)

Project must include:

  * Your name.
  * An image of you, or something that represents you.
  * A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories.
    * For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.
  * An “About Me” section.
    * Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).
    * Your current interests, hobbies, and skills.
  * A gh-pages branch so that your site may be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio

### Goals
1. Meet MVP requirements
2. Enhance styling to personalize & align with design sense
3. _Stretch Goal: Feature CS50 project built over the summer_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repo to your workspace.

<!-- KO Ask Yourself: -->

<!-- [x] Do I need to run a server?  -->

<!-- [x] How should I set up my databases?  -->

<!-- [x] Is there other code this application depends on? -->

<!-- _{Epicodus recommends deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_ -->
