            <strong>Hi! I'm Kirsten.</strong> I'm currently enrolled in a full time, full stack engineering program at <a href="http://epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about building things that solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bringing fourteen years of design experience to a new chapter of my career. As a designer, my specialty is translating complex techincal concepts to collaborators so that the whole team can weigh trade-offs and make smart, sustainable choices <em>together</em>. As an engineer, I apply years of collaborative problem solving to a new workflow.
          </p>
          <p>As a huge fan of Brene Brown's work around <a href="https://brenebrown.com/resources/living-into-our-values/"><em>Living Into Our Values</em></a>, in the workpace and in one's personal life; and, in the spirit of vulnerability, I share my core values to give a sense of who I am and what's important to me:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Intentionality</li>
            <li>Authenticity</li>
            <li>Creativity</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I live in Los Angeles and enjoy soup. To get in touch, <a href="mailto:kirsten.opstad@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
