        <h5>A Tool for Expanding Compassion</h5>
        <p>Spoons is a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL.</p>
        <p>Powered by the dynamic spoon counter deducts spoons based on activities user selects, simulating the experience of expending energy throughout the day.</p>
        <p>
          Registered users are able to change/update "spoon values" of activities, add new activities to their profile and change their "daily spoon count." Preferences are stored/updated in a SQL database.</p>
        <p>
          Prompted by a conversation with a friend about communicating one's capacity to their partner, the purpose of Spoons is built to help expand compassion between partners, roommates, collaborators & colleagues.</p>
