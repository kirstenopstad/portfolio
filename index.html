            <strong>Hi! I'm Kirsten.</strong> I'm currently enrolled in a full time, full stack engineering program at <a href="http://epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about building things that solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bringing fourteen years of design experience to a new chapter of my career. As a designer, my specialty is translating complex techincal concepts to collaborators so that the whole team can weigh trade-offs and make smart, sustainable choices <em>together</em>. As an engineer, I apply years of collaborative problem solving to a new workflow.
